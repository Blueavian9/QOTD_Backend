- ii. Add lists for each major task (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done")  ~ checked ~

## 1b: Add Cards for Each Step
- i. Create a card titled "Read Swagger API-docs"
- ii. Create a card titled "List API Endpoints"
- iii. Create a card titled "Define Frontend Features"
- iv. Create a card titled "Map Endpoints to Features"
- v. Create a card titled "Design UI Components"
- vi. Create a card titled "Implement Authentication"
- vii. Create a card titled "Set Up API Calls"
- viii. Create a card titled "Integrate API with UI"
- ix. Create a card titled "Test API Integration"
- x. Create a card titled "Deploy Frontend"

## 1c: Break Each Card into Sub-steps
- i. For "Read Swagger API-docs":
- a. Open the Swagger documentation
- b. Review the available endpoints
- c. Note authentication requirements
- d. Note request/response formats



## 2. CREATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE DIAGRAM IN Excallidraw.com: 
## Pro Tip:

- Review Excallidraw's documentation for drawing tools and features.
- Research example infrastructure diagrams to understand common practices.

## 2a: Set Up Excallidraw
- Open Excallidraw
- Create a new drawing

## 2b: Define Components
- Draw the frontend (React App)
- Draw the backend (API Server)
- Draw the database
- Draw external services (e.g., Auth0)

## 2c: Connect Components
- Draw lines to connect frontend to backend
- Draw lines to connect the backend to the database
- Draw lines to connect the backend to external services

## 2d: Add Annotations
- Label each component
- Label each connection with the type of interaction (e.g., API call, data retrieval)



## Pro Tip:
- Explore Figma's documentation and tutorials for design and prototyping.
- Look at design examples and UI kits to get inspiration.
## 3. CREATE A DESIGN FILE OF THE UI IN Figma.com: 

## 3a: Set Up Figma
- Open Figma
- Create a new design file

3b: Define the UI Layout
- Create a frame for each screen (e.g., login, dashboard)
- Add placeholders for UI components (e.g., buttons, forms)

## 3c: Design Components
- Design buttons
- Design forms
- Design navigation elements

## 3d: Style Components
- Choose a color scheme
- Choose fonts and typography
- Apply styles to components

## 3e: Prototype Interactions
- Link components to simulate navigation
- Test the prototype for usability



## 4. BUILD A Vite React App USING TailwindCSS: 
## Pro Tip:
Follow Vite and TailwindCSS documentation step-by-step for setup and configuration.
Seek your mentor's advice when facing challenges with setting up the project or integrating features.
Use online resources like tutorials and forums for troubleshooting and best practices.

## 4a. Set Up the Project
- Install Vite
- Create a new Vite project
- Install TailwindCSS

## 4b. Configure TailwindCSS
- Create tailwind.config.js
- Set up postcss.config.js
- Add Tailwind directives to CSS

## 4c. Build the App Structure
- Create necessary pages (e.g., Home, Login, Dashboard)
- Create components (e.g., Navbar, Footer)

## 4d. Implement Features
- Set up routing
- Implement state management (if needed)
- Integrate API calls

## 4e. Style the App
- Apply TailwindCSS classes
- Customize components as needed






5. TEST THAT IT WORKS AND STYLE HOWEVER YOU WANT: 
Additional Steps:
Consult testing frameworks documentation (e.g., Jest for unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end testing).
Ask your mentor for guidance on writing effective tests.
Use TailwindCSS documentation for styling tips and customization options.

5a. Testing
i. Write unit tests for components
ii. Write integration tests for API calls
iii. Perform end-to-end testing

5b. Styling
i. Review the app for consistency in design
ii. Make any final adjustments to styles
iii. Ensure responsiveness across devices

5c. Deployment
i. Set up a deployment pipeline (e.g., using Vercel, Netlify)
ii. Deploy the app
iii. Test the deployed app for any issues
